## Introduction:

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. They have trained it on a massive amount of text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics and questions.

Its popularity stems from its ability to provide fast and accurate responses to a vast array of questions and topics. Many people use it to answer their questions, help with research, or even for entertainment. It can provide information on everything from science and technology to history, literature, and more.

Since its creation, it has become increasingly popular, with many people using it as a virtual assistant or an educational tool. They have integrated it into many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support services.

Despite its increasing popularity, it is still being developed and improved by the team at OpenAI. As a result, its capabilities continue to grow, making it even more useful for those who need its help.

## Limitations:

Although ChatGPT is called Artificial Intelligence, it is not without limitations. They trained the model on the data of many articles found online, so when a question is posed, it can recover the piece of information from the vast database of information. However, the integrity of the information upon which they trained this can be questioned anytime. 

This is a tool that can be utilised to make our life simpler, just like a dishwasher or a train has improved our life. So, what is the hype going on around about this tool taking our over jobs? Even the people at OpenAI have published a paper about whose jobs are in question and can be enhanced/made obsolete by this wonderful tool.

## Once upon a Time:

To understand this fear, which I prefer to call a misconception or ignorance, take Leonardo da Vinci for example, he has to use his expertise in chemistry to create coolers with a water base and oil base to layer them and blend them to generate impeccable art. Today, all you need to know is which tool to used to do the same in a digital art tools like Procreate or Photoshop. One needn’t know the depths of chemistry to generate art. Now with Ai, all you need to do is to phrase intelligently for AI to generate art, then one can touchup on the generated art!

Fast forward a few centuries. Let me take you to the industrial age. Back in the old days, they hired housemaids to help in the kitchen, washing utensils, washing clothes, cleaning house and other miscellaneous chores that make up for daily maintenance of a household. They utilised horses and Bulls to transport goods around. With the invention of steam engines and washing machines, we put the jobs of the cart drivers and housemaids to peril. Right? No, the old skills require achieving the job have been put to question by much efficient methods. A steam engine will not drive itself, it still needs a trained professional to operate, a washing machine cannot pick up and wash all the clothes by itself, someone has to put it in, add the washing powder and switch it on to work. The only thing changing here is the skill set required to perform the said task, not the job itself. 

We usually isomorphic the skill set to a job when it is not the case. This ignorance causes the ruckus and losing job opportunities during every Industrial Revolution. Now we are in the transition phase for Industrial Revolution 4.0 and many people who are not opportunists are feeling threatened by the tools like AI for their job position. They do not realise the opportunity to upgrade the skill set to continue the job.

## Back to Present:

{{< article link="/posts/multiverse-hypothesis/" >}}

The above article, in almost its entirety, is written by ChatGPT. However, it is I who asked the right questions that made up the text present in the above article be generated by ChatGPT. So, the art of creative writing is not dead, just the process and tools like grammar, tropes, story etc are taken care of by AI. In the above article, the idea for the topic, the tags, the description, conclusion and most of the article were generated by ChatGPT. The supervision, edits and gluing is done by me. There are a few sentences that I have sandwiched in multiple locations. These are subject expert’s opinions or corrections that can be done only by expert. However, the question of what to write and how to present was in my hands when I asked the questions to ChatGPT. So, writing has changed significantly, but not the task itself.

## Back to Limitations:

Take this query and response, for example.

Sounds good, right? Now, look closely at the highlighted part.

Here, if you aren’t aware of the subject, you cannot find the mistake in this description. The whole point of tetra lemma, a non-classical logic, is to have features like a statement and its negation be true or false simultaneously. Since this answer is faulty, and so will be on multiple research frontier related topics, one still needs the expert human opinion to verify the accuracy of the ChatGPT. So, one needn’t worry about AI taking over the jobs, rather look at it as a misunderstood opportunity to grow personally and professionally.
