| Characteristics              | Inception | Matrix | Caitanya |
| :---------------- | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| Source | The mind of the principal dreamer constructs the dream space | Computer constructs the dream space | Energies of the Lord construct the material world |
| Ways to Realize we are in a dream | Try to figure out the origin of the event | Somebody from outside has to show it to realize | Spiritual Master guides us(both the *paramatma* and the representative) |
| Purpose of Existence | To steal confidential information or to implant an idea (other use cases may be possible as the main character says in the movie) | To keep human minds tricked so that machines can derive energy from biochemical sources so that they can exist | To realize we are spirit soul and servants of the Lord |
| Defying Physical Laws | Can create anything including paradoxical spaces | Machine code can be tweaked only by the One and Smith to bend laws according to their will | Nothing much, we are trapped, like using gloved hands to feel the texture of surfaces. Limited functionalities only |
| Getting Out of Dream State | Die, Sharp Excitation etc inside dream or water immersion and chair tipping from outside | Call Line and a person from outside has to bring him back by hacking into the matrix | Thinking about Krishna at the time of death/Engaging in Devotional Service |
| Addiction to Dream State | Quite Possible | Quite Possible | Always – it exists for deaddiction to mastering tendency |
| Ability to Learn | Nope, only based on dreamer’s experiences and creativity | Load modules in a jiffy by contacting the operator (similar to hot-swap) | Hard Work Ahead. |
| Levels of Dream State(compounding effects) | 4-5 (acc to the movie) but may improvise with much powerful sedative | 2 levels only(in the trilogy) but 3 levels existed in the 4th Movie(the modal simulation) | No idea |
| Bottom Level? | Limbo – able to get up after brain is as fried as KFC!! | NA | Hallucinations? |
| Inside/Outside Communications | Only music played in ears | Can call and talk with the outside operator, and nanobot technology (Paramagnetic Oscillation) | Chanting Mahamantra, Inspiration |
| Mixing Dream State with Real World | NA – Only Reconstruction by dreamers is possible | NA – Only Reconstruction by Matrix is possible | Quite Possible |
| Ability to be fooled | Quite Possible | Quite Possible | Quite Possible – in fact happens almost all the time |
| Death in Dream World | No Issues | Die in Reality | No Issues |
| Confusion regarding the Real Reality | Quite Possible | Possible if we try deliberately | No Possibility as Spiritual World is available for self-realized(if Krishna desires possible) |
| Time Relativity | Time becomes fast in the dream state – more compounding slow time in deeper levels | Absolute Time(but Neo can change the speed of time inside the matrix) | Eternal time is the slowest? Within the universe itself, we have time relativity |
| Evolution of Species | Not possible unless a dreamer wants dragons and similar stuff. Relies on the creativity of the dreamer. | Matrix evolves to simulate a world to trap the human mind’s complexity in the false world. Programs evolve to make matrix close replica of reality | Yes, but not Darwinian. It is more complex than that. |
| Déjà vu | Quite Possible | Defines glitches in Matrix (possibly by smith or architect or oracle) | Quite Possible |
| Controller’s Influence on Reality | The inception of Ideas can influence events in the real world | The matrix can send machines to destroy Zion, threatening the lives | Reality is sweet enough beyond conceivable reference scales |
| *klesas* (troubles) | Depends on the dreamer and his subconscious subjects | Quite possible | Designed to remind us, to contemplate reality and endeavour to achieve it |
| Cues to Suspect the Dream State and Existence of other Reality | Contemplate how we ended up in that particular scene | Quite Narrow Possibilities | Quite narrow possibilities but possible if we endeavour to realise the Absolute truth |
| Resurrection | Not possible if the dreamer dreams it | Possible for Neo and Trinity | Possible if the Lord desires |
| Love and other related feelings | Feels Quite Real | Chemical Interactions in the body and firing of associated neurons. But could feel quite real as the mind tricks to believe | Just an illusion if it has nothing to do with Lord |
