I just don't know anymore.

The above phrase is a constant reminder (for me) of all the things I am conscious, about being ignorant. As **James Clerk Maxwell** says,
> Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.

I believe that by unveiling our ignorance on ignorance, we make the first step towards realizing knowledge. To make efforts in gathering knowledge, I turn towards Physics, Mathematics and Philosophy.
## Short Version
I'm enrolled to Masters in Physics program at Ruprecht Karl Universität Heidelberg. My primary interests that I wish to explore are 
- Topologies of Time, 
- Quantum Gravity, 
- Philosophy of Physics,
- Structure of Gauge Theories.

Scientific Visualizations are an interest of mine, and wish to do more of it in the future. I occasionally go on cycling rides.

## Long Version

will post soon
