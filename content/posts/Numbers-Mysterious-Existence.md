description: "This verse speaks about the significance of numbers and how they reveal the truth of one's heart's desires. The poet expresses that although numbers are present everywhere, not everyone is wise enough to understand their deeper meaning. The poet acknowledges the power of numbers, which can disclose the hunger of one's beloved. However, the poet also recognizes that numbers can be deceptive, as they can hide the true identity of the greatest mathematician. The verse concludes with a humble prayer to the lotus-eyed Lord, acknowledging the poet's limitations in eloquence and intelligence, yet expressing earnest effort in composing these prayers."

Numbers, Numbers,<br>
In All Quarters,<br>
But None Wise,<br>
To Get a Glimpse<br>

For Numbers Speaketh<br>
The Gospel Truth<br>
that divulge the Heart's hunger<br>
of thy paramour<br>

He masquerades<br>
behind the veil<br>
Of the Numbers that discloses<br>
the Greatest Mathematician to prevail

Following in the footsteps of Srila Yamunacarya, I pray:

kim caisa sakty-atisayena ne te’nukampyah<br>
stota’pi tu stuti-krtena parisramena<br>
tatra sramastu sulabho mama manda-buddheh<br>
ity-udyamo’yam uctio mama cabja-netra

O lotus-eyed Lord, this poet does not expect to earn Your mercy by a display of powerful eloquence. His intelligence is dull and these prayers were composed with great labor.(**Sri Stotra Ratna Verse 9**)
