## hello there
this is the first post that i am trialing for this hugo site.

### next steps
if all goes well, i might sync this git project to github and deploy it to cloudfare

## some stuff to worry about

- item one
- item two
- item 3

1. list one
1. list two


$$ \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} $$

this is a text with inline math, just testing the stuff guys, ensure it all works great  \\( \varphi = e^\varepsilon \psi \\).

om-tat-sat
