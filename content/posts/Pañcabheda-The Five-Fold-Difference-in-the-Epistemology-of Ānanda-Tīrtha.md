description: "The concept of pañcabheda, or five-fold difference, lies at the heart of the epistemology of Ānanda Tīrtha, as described by Dr B N K Sharma in his book \"Philosophy of Srila Madhvacarya\". These intrinsic differences are found in the universe and are enumerated as the following: the difference between Lord Viṣṇu and Jīva (individual souls), the difference between Lord Viṣṇu and jaḍa (non-sentient material entities), the difference between individual Jīvas, the difference between Jīvas and jaḍa (non-sentient material entities), and the difference between one jaḍa and another. These five differences are considered to be real according to Madhvacarya's philosophy."

*pañcabheda* or five-fold difference lies at the heart of the epistemology of Ānanda Tīrtha. These are intrinsic differences found in the universe. They are enumerated as follows:

1. difference between Lord *Viṣṇu* and *Jīva*
1. difference between Lord *Viṣṇu* and *jaḍa*, non-sentient material entities
1. difference between individual *Jīvas*
1. difference between *Jīvas* and *jaḍa*, non-sentient material entities
1. difference between one *jaḍa* and the other

These five differences are real according to Madhvacarya.
