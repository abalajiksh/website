description: "This verse reflects on the concept of choice and nature through the use of insect metaphors. It asks the reader to consider what they choose to be in life, whether it be an ant, a spider, or a bee. The verse also highlights the immanent nature of existence, suggesting that all creatures are interconnected and share a common destiny. However, it also hints at the consequences of denying or avoiding making a choice, emphasizing the need to ultimately make a decision. The verse encapsulates themes of self-determination, interconnectedness, and the inevitability of choice."

What do you choose to be? <br>
An Ant? A Spider? <br>
Or perhaps, a Bee?<br>
<br>
Whatever the choice, <br>
all dwell in the immanent <br>
And the time besiege <br>
when thee needs choose <br>
To deny all the three.
